**Metamesh** is a Unity package that generates primitive meshes. It works as a
custom asset importer but doesn't import anything from an input file. Instead
of importing a file, it reads properties from a metafile and procedurally
generates a mesh.

At the moment, it only supports very basic primitive shapes.

- Plane
- Box
- Sphere (UV sphere)
- Icosphere
- Cylinder
- Rounded box
- Disc
- Ring
- Cone
